# Setup Guide

After following this guide, you have a working instance of WiMoVE. WiMoVE provides a package you can install on your OpenWRT router but needs some additional services in your network to be useful. One of them is the route reflector and the other one is the gateway. The route reflector is part of the control plane and distributes the information between the access points and the gateway. The gateway is responsible to terminate the overlay networks and provide internet access. We have separate Wiki entries for the setup of an [access point](https://github.com/WiMoVE-OSS/WiMoVE/wiki/Setup---Access-Point), the [route reflector](https://github.com/WiMoVE-OSS/WiMoVE/wiki/Setup---Route-Reflector) and the [gateway](https://github.com/WiMoVE-OSS/WiMoVE/wiki/Setup-gateway). If you encounter any issues during the setup, feel free to drop us a message.

Especially when setting up multiple access points or many VXLANs on the gateway, deployment can be quite tedious. In a separate repository, we provide ansible playbooks that we use for deployment. They can be a good starting point for you, to build your own ansible playbooks.
